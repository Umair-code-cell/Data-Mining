# Data Mining-I Project - University of Pisa

## Introduction

The challenge of this project is to predict if the car purchased at the Auction is bad buy. One of the biggest challenges of an auto dealership purchasing a used car at an auto auction is the risk of that the vehicle might have serious issues that prevent it from being sold to customers. The auto community calls these unfortunate purchases "kicks". Kicked cars often result when there are tampered odometers, mechanical issues the dealer is not able to address, issues with getting the vehicle title from the seller, or some other unforeseen problem. Kick cars can be very costly to dealers after transportation cost, throwaway repair work, and market losses in reselling the vehicle. Modelers who can figure out which cars have a higher risk of being kicked can provide real value to dealerships trying to provide the best inventory selection possible to their customers.

## Tasks


### Data Understanding:
Explore the dataset with the analytical tools studied and write a concise “data understanding” report describing data semantics, assessing data quality, the distribution of the variables and the pairwise correlations.
### Clustering analysis: 
Explore the dataset using various clustering techniques. Carefully describe your's decisions for each algorithm and which are the advantages provided by the different approaches.
### Classification: 
Explore the dataset using classification trees. Use them to predict the target variable.
### Association Rules: 
Explore the dataset using frequent pattern mining and association rules extraction. Then use them to predict a variable either for replacing missing values or to predict target variable.
